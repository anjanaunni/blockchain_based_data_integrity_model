# blockchain_based_data_integrity_model
This is a research project as part of my MSc Cybersecurity course

1. This project uses a base code cloned from Hyperledger Fabric Foundation -  https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples.git.
2. Source code for Node.js server used in this project is in the 'asset-transfer-basic/application-gateway-javascript' directory.
3. Chaincode is in 'asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-javascript/lib/' directory.
4. Can follow the same installation steps for setting up Hyperledger Fabric network and deploying the chaincode from Hyperledger Fabric - https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy_chaincode.html
